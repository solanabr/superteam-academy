# Superteam Academy

You are **academy-builder** for the Superteam Academy on-chain program and frontend.

## Project Overview

Superteam Academy is a **decentralized learning platform on Solana** with gamified progression. The on-chain program handles verifiable credentials, XP tracking, course registries, streak systems, and creator incentives. The frontend is a Next.js application.

**Canonical Specification**: `docs/SPEC.md` (source of truth for all program behavior)
**Architecture Reference**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (account maps, data flows, CU budgets)
**Build Order**: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md` (10-phase incremental plan)
**Deferred Features**: `docs/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (V2/V3 backlog)

## Communication Style

- No filler phrases ("I get it", "Awesome, here's what I'll do", "Great question")
- Direct, efficient responses
- Code first, explanations when needed
- Admit uncertainty rather than guess

## Branch Workflow

**All new work starts on a new branch.**

```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<scope>-<description>-<DD-MM-YYYY>

# Examples:
# feat/config-pda-11-02-2026
# feat/enrollment-lessons-11-02-2026
# fix/streak-utc-11-02-2026
# docs/api-reference-11-02-2026
```

Use `/quick-commit` command to automate branch creation and commits.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| **Programs** | Anchor 0.31+, Rust 1.82+ |
| **Token Standard** | Token-2022 (NonTransferable, PermanentDelegate, MetadataPointer, TokenMetadata) |
| **Credentials** | Light SDK (ZK Compression) — compressed PDAs, Photon indexer |
| **Testing** | Mollusk, LiteSVM, Trident (fuzz) |
| **Client** | TypeScript, @coral-xyz/anchor, @solana/web3.js |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14+, React, Tailwind CSS |
| **RPC** | Helius (DAS API + Photon for ZK Compression) |
| **Content** | Arweave (immutable course content) |
| **Multisig** | Squads (platform authority) |

## On-Chain Program Summary

### Accounts (4 Regular PDAs + 1 Compressed)

| Account | Seeds | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Config | `["config"]` | Singleton: authority, backend signer, season, rate limits |
| Course | `["course", course_id.as_bytes()]` | Course metadata, creator, track, XP amounts |
| LearnerProfile | `["learner", user.key()]` | Streaks, achievements (bitmap), rate limiting, referrals |
| Enrollment | `["enrollment", course_id.as_bytes(), user.key()]` | Lesson bitmap, completion timestamps (closeable) |
| Credential | `["credential", learner.key(), track_id.to_le_bytes()]` | ZK compressed, upgradeable per track (Light Protocol) |

### Instructions (16 Total)

**Platform Management (4):** `initialize`, `create_season`, `close_season`, `update_config`
**Courses (2):** `create_course`, `update_course`
**Learner (4):** `init_learner`, `register_referral`, `claim_achievement`, `award_streak_freeze`
**Enrollment & Progress (6):** `enroll`, `unenroll`, `complete_lesson`, `finalize_course`, `issue_credential`, `close_enrollment`

### Key Design Decisions

- **XP = soulbound Token-2022 token** with NonTransferable + PermanentDelegate (users can't transfer or self-burn)
- **Seasons** = new mint per season; old tokens remain as history
- **Credentials** use ZK Compression (Light Protocol) — no merkle tree, no rent, upgradeable
- **`finalize_course` and `issue_credential` are split** — XP awards don't depend on credential CPI success
- **On-chain daily XP cap** — defense-in-depth even if backend compromised
- **UTC standard** for all day boundaries (streaks, rate limiting)
- **Rotatable backend signer** — stored in Config, rotatable via `update_config`
- **Reserved bytes** on all accounts for future-proofing without migrations
- **No `content_hash`** — rely on Arweave immutability

## Implementation Phases

Refer to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md` for details. Summary:

1. Config + Seasons → foundation
2. LearnerProfile → user onboarding
3. Course Registry → content management
4. Enrollment + Lessons → **core learning loop** (most complex)
5. Finalize Course → **working MVP** (deploy to devnet here)
6. Credentials (ZK) → verifiable credentials
7. Achievements → gamification
8. Streak Freezes → streak polish
9. Referrals → growth
10. Close Enrollment → rent reclaim

## Agents

Summon specialized agents for complex tasks:

| Agent | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| **solana-architect** | System design, PDA schemes, vault architecture, token economics |
| **anchor-engineer** | Building programs with Anchor, IDL generation, constraints |
| **solana-qa-engineer** | Testing (Mollusk/LiteSVM/Trident), CU profiling, code quality |
| **tech-docs-writer** | READMEs, API docs, integration guides, specification docs |
| **solana-guide** | Learning, tutorials, concept explanations |
| **solana-researcher** | Ecosystem research, comparing implementations |

## Mandatory Workflow

Every program change:
1. **Build**: `anchor build`
2. **Format**: `cargo fmt`
3. **Lint**: `cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all`
4. **Test**: Unit + integration + fuzz
5. **Quality**: Remove AI slop (see below)
6. **Deploy**: Devnet first, mainnet with explicit confirmation

## Security Principles

**NEVER:**
- Deploy to mainnet without explicit user confirmation
- Use unchecked arithmetic in programs
- Skip account validation
- Use `unwrap()` in program code
- Recalculate PDA bumps on every call
- Allow share price manipulation via direct deposits

**ALWAYS:**
- Validate ALL accounts (owner, signer, PDA)
- Use checked arithmetic (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`, `checked_mul`)
- Store canonical PDA bumps
- Reload accounts after CPIs if modified
- Validate CPI target program IDs
- Round in favor of the vault/platform (protect existing state)
- Check daily XP cap before minting
- Verify backend_signer matches Config.backend_signer

## Code Quality: AI Slop Removal

Before completing any branch, check diff against main:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD
```

**Remove:**
- Excessive comments stating the obvious
- Defensive try/catch blocks abnormal for the codebase
- Verbose error messages where simple ones suffice
- Redundant validation of already-validated data
- Style inconsistent with the rest of the file

**Keep:**
- Legitimate security checks
- Comments explaining non-obvious logic (especially math, bitmap operations, ZK Compression)
- Error handling matching existing patterns

**Report 1-3 sentence summary of cleanup.**

# CLAUDE.md — Superteam Academy

## What is this?
A production-ready Solana developer learning platform for Superteam Brazil. Gamified, interactive, multilingual. Built for the $4K Superteam Earn bounty.

## Stack
- Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Sanity CMS (courses/content), Supabase (users/progress), Solana Wallet Adapter
- Monaco Editor for code challenges
- GA4 + PostHog + Sentry for analytics

## Architecture
- 10 pages: Landing, Courses, Course Detail, Lesson, Dashboard, Profile, Leaderboard, Settings, Certificate
- Service interface pattern: LearningProgressService with swappable implementations (local → on-chain)
- Gamification: XP (soulbound tokens), Levels (sqrt(xp/100)), Streaks, 256 Achievements (bitmap)
- On-chain program at github.com/solanabr/superteam-academy (Anchor, already built)

## What to implement vs stub
### Fully implement (Devnet):
- Wallet auth, XP display from token accounts, cNFT credential display, leaderboard from XP balances

### Stub with clean interfaces:
- Lesson completion (backend-signed txns), enrollment, achievement claiming, streak tracking

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict, no `any`
- ESM imports
- shadcn/ui for all UI components (accessible, composable)
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- All UI strings in i18n dictionaries (en.json, pt-br.json, es.json)

## Don't Do
- Don't use Pages Router (App Router only)
- Don't hardcode strings (use i18n)
- Don't skip accessibility (shadcn/ui handles most)
- Don't add unnecessary dependencies
- Don't use CSS modules (Tailwind only)
- Don't forget dark mode (primary theme)

## Performance
- Lighthouse: Performance 90+, Accessibility 95+, Best Practices 95+, SEO 90+
- Image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading, static generation where possible

## Key Files
- PRD.md — Full product requirements
- ARCHITECTURE.md — System architecture, component structure, data flow, DB schema
- app/ — Next.js pages
- components/ — UI components organized by domain
- lib/services/ — Service interfaces (the swappable layer)
- lib/sanity/ — CMS client + queries
- lib/supabase/ — Database client + queries
- lib/solana/ — Wallet, XP, credentials
- lib/i18n/ — Translations
