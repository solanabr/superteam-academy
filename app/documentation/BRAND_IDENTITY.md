# CapySolBuild Brand Identity

This document captures the brand rationale for the project name and logo in one place.

## Why the name “CapySolBuild” works

CapySolBuild is a strong name because it combines the project’s three core pillars into one memorable identity:

- **Capy**
  - Brings in Brazilian identity through the capybara mascot.
  - Signals a friendly, community-driven culture.

- **Sol**
  - Immediately anchors the platform in the Solana ecosystem.

- **Build**
  - Acts as a direct call-to-action for developers.
  - Emphasizes practical execution: writing code and shipping dApps.

In short, the name is descriptive, brandable, and aligned with the platform’s purpose.

## Logo design explanation

This logo was designed to visually capture the core elements of the Superteam Brazil LMS bounty: Web3 technology, education, and Brazilian culture.

### 1) The Capybara Mascot

The central figure is a stylized capybara, an iconic and beloved animal native to Brazil.

- **Cultural connection:** Instantly roots the platform in Brazilian identity.
- **Community + calm:** Capybaras are known for being social, adaptable, and calm—ideal traits for a developer community learning complex Solana and Rust concepts.
- **Approachability:** Makes the platform feel welcoming rather than intimidating.

### 2) Circuit board and blockchain lines

The capybara head uses continuous lines and geometric nodes.

- **Technical foundation:** Represents circuit boards, code logic, and blockchain networks.
- **Developer focus:** Communicates that this is a technical platform for builders, not a generic forum.
- **Learning paths:** Interconnected lines also symbolize tracks, progression, and structured learning flow.

### 3) Graduation cap (mortarboard)

A classic academic cap sits on top of the capybara.

- **LMS signal:** Directly represents education, achievement, and completion.
- **Credential link:** Connects visually to the platform’s on-chain rewards model, including XP and Metaplex Core credentials.

### 4) Gradient color palette

The logo uses a sweeping gradient from deep violet to vibrant teal and warm orange.

- **Solana reference:** Purple + teal/green palette echoes Solana’s visual identity.
- **Ecosystem clarity:** Immediately signals Web3/Solana context.
- **Brazil energy:** Orange/gold adds vibrant warmth aligned with Superteam Brazil’s tone.
