## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- A Supabase account and project
- A Sanity account and project

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Supabase (already configured via integration)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Sanity CMS
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token

# Solana
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Database setup** (already done if you used Supabase integration):
   - Tables are created via migrations
   - RLS policies are enabled
   - Initial achievements are seeded

3. **Run development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Database Schema

The platform uses the following main tables:

- `profiles` - User profiles (extends auth.users)
- `user_progress` - XP, levels, streaks tracking
- `courses` - Course catalog (synced from Sanity)
- `lessons` - Lesson content (synced from Sanity)
- `enrollments` - User course enrollments
- `lesson_completions` - Completed lessons and XP earned
- `achievements` - Available achievements
- `user_achievements` - Earned achievements
- `community_posts` - Forum posts
- `community_comments` - Forum comments

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled.

## Key Features Implementation

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication via Supabase
- Wallet-based authentication (planned)
- Automatic profile creation on signup

### Course Management
- Courses managed in Sanity CMS
- Cached in Supabase for performance
- Lessons support video, article, interactive, and quiz types

### Lesson Experience
- Reading lessons render rich content via Portable Text
- Coding lessons display instructions above the editor and load starter code from Sanity
- Quiz lessons load questions, options, and correct answers from Sanity
- Code challenges include language metadata and optional test cases

### Catalog Search & Sorting
- Search courses by title and description
- Sort by Newest, Popular, or Difficulty
- Home page highlights 5 featured courses

### Gamification
- XP earned for completing lessons
- Level progression system
- Daily streak tracking
- Achievement badges (9 initial achievements)

### Blockchain Integration
- On-chain XP and credential display via wallet connection on Devnet
- Service layer abstractions ready for future on-chain writes
- Enrollment and lesson completion use Supabase

### Course Completion & Certificate Flow
- On the final lesson, completion prompts the learner to get the certificate immediately.
- If course progress is below 100%, the user sees the exact completion percentage and missing lessons.
- If completion is valid, certificate mint transaction is prepared and signed from the connected wallet.
- After successful mint/save (or if certificate already exists), the user gets a popup to open `/certificates` directly.

### Enrollment Flow
- Enroll via `/api/enroll` with duplicate enrollment protection
- Courses synced from Sanity to Supabase when needed

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Via Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

2. **Via Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add all `.env.local` variables to Vercel project settings
   - Supabase variables should already be set via integration

### Post-Deployment

1. Update Supabase Auth URLs:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Set Site URL to your Vercel domain
   - Add redirect URLs

2. Test authentication flow

3. Seed initial content in Sanity (if using)

## Development Guidelines

### Service Layer
All blockchain and data operations use service abstractions:

- `blockchain.service.ts` - On-chain operations (stubbed)
- `course.service.ts` - Course and lesson management
- `user.service.ts` - User profile and progress

This makes it easy to swap implementations later.

### Adding New Pages

1. Create page in `app/` directory
2. Use services for data fetching
3. Follow existing component patterns
4. Ensure responsive design

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow the existing color system (teal primary, yellow accent)
- Use semantic design tokens from `globals.css`
- Ensure dark mode compatibility

## Testing

(To be implemented)

- Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
- E2E tests: Playwright
- Integration tests for services
