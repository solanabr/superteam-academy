About
Superteam Brazil is building the ultimate learning platform for Solana-native developers — an open-source, interactive education hub that takes builders from zero to deploying production-ready dApps.

Think "Codecademy meets Cyfrin Updraft" for Solana: gamified progression, interactive coding challenges, on-chain credentials, and a community-driven learning experience built for crypto natives.

We're looking for talented developers and cracked agents to build this platform from the ground up. The winning submission will become the foundation for Solana developer education across Latin America and beyond.

Overview
Build a production-ready learning management system (LMS) for Solana development, research, and power users.

The platform should:

Deliver interactive, project-based courses with integrated code editing

Track learner progress with gamification (XP, streaks, achievements)

Issue on-chain credentials for course completion

Support multiple languages (Portuguese, Spanish, English)

Integrate analytics for user behavior insights

Be fully open-source and forkable by other communities



On-Chain Program
The platform's gamification and credential logic lives on-chain via an Anchor program. The full spec and code live at github.com/solanabr/superteam-academy — your delivery should be a PR to this repo (inside it's according folder following monorepo structure).

Here's what you need to know:

XP is a soulbound fungible token (Token-2022, NonTransferable). A learner's token balance = their XP. Levels are derived: Level = floor(sqrt(xp / 100)).

Credentials are evolving compressed NFTs (Metaplex Bubblegum). One cNFT per learning track that upgrades as the learner progresses — no wallet clutter.

Courses are on-chain PDAs that spawn Enrollment PDAs per learner. Lesson progress is tracked via bitmaps.

Enrollments are closeable after completion to reclaim rent. Proof is preserved via the credential cNFT and transaction history.

Streaks are activity-derived — updated as a side effect of complete_lesson, not a separate check-in.

Achievements use a bitmap (256 possible) on the Learner PDA.

Leaderboard is off-chain — derived by indexing XP token balances (Helius DAS API or custom indexer).

What to Implement vs. Stub
Fully implement on Devnet:

Wallet authentication (multi-wallet adapter)

XP balance display from token accounts

Credential (cNFT) display and verification

Leaderboard by indexing XP balances

Stub with clean abstractions (we connect the on-chain program later):

Lesson completion flow (backend-signed transactions)

Course enrollment

Achievement claiming

Streak tracking

Create clean service interfaces so we can swap local storage for on-chain calls:

interface LearningProgressService {
  getProgress(userId: string, courseId: string): Promise<Progress>;
  completeLesson(userId: string, courseId: string, lessonIndex: number): Promise<void>;
  getXP(userId: string): Promise<number>;
  getStreak(userId: string): Promise<StreakData>;
  getLeaderboard(timeframe: 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'alltime'): Promise<LeaderboardEntry[]>;
  getCredentials(wallet: PublicKey): Promise<Credential[]>;
}
Tech Stack
Choose one frontend framework:

React + Next.js 14+ (App Router)

Vue 3 + Nuxt 3

Svelte + SvelteKit

Required technologies:

TypeScript — strict mode, no any types

Tailwind CSS — custom theme with design tokens

Components — shadcn/ui, Radix, or Headless UI (accessible, composable primitives)

Headless CMS — Sanity, Strapi, Contentful, or similar

Auth — Solana Wallet Adapter (multi-wallet) + Google sign-in. GitHub sign-in as bonus.

Analytics — GA4 + heatmaps (Hotjar/PostHog/Clarity) + Sentry error monitoring

i18n — PT-BR, ES, EN from day one. All UI strings externalized, language switcher in header/settings. Course content can remain in original language.

Deployment — Vercel/Netlify with preview deployments

Code Editor Integration
Implement using one of: embedded Solana Playground (iframe), Monaco Editor, or CodeMirror 6.

Must support: Rust/TypeScript/JSON syntax highlighting, basic autocompletion, error display, and pass/fail feedback for challenges.

Account Linking
Users should be able to:

Sign up with wallet OR Google OR GitHub

Link additional auth methods later

Use any linked method to sign in

Wallet linking is required to finalize courses and receive credentials

Gamification System
XP & Leveling
XP comes from on-chain soulbound tokens. Display the balance and derive level: Level = floor(sqrt(totalXP / 100)).

Rewards are tracked on-chain through interaction with the program at github.com/solanabr/superteam-academy. For the stubbed implementation, track XP locally — on-chain minting will be connected later.

XP rewards (configurable per course):

Complete lesson — 10–50 XP (based on difficulty)

Complete challenge — 25–100 XP

Complete course — 500–2,000 XP

Daily streak bonus — 10 XP

First completion of the day — 25 XP

Streaks
Track consecutive days with activity. Visual calendar showing streak history. Streak freeze (bonus feature). Milestone rewards at 7, 30, and 100 days — these map to on-chain credential upgrades.

Achievements/Badges
Progress — "First Steps", "Course Completer", "Speed Runner"

Streaks — "Week Warrior", "Monthly Master", "Consistency King"

Skills — "Rust Rookie", "Anchor Expert", "Full Stack Solana"

Community — "Helper", "First Comment", "Top Contributor"

Special — "Early Adopter", "Bug Hunter", "Perfect Score"

Up to 256 achievements supported by the on-chain bitmap.

CMS Integration
Courses contain modules, modules contain lessons. Each lesson is either content (reading/video) or challenge (interactive coding).

The CMS should support: visual content editor with markdown and code blocks, media management, draft/publish workflow, and course metadata (difficulty, duration, XP, track association).

We'll provide a mock course with sample content for testing.

Performance
Lighthouse targets: Performance 90+, Accessibility 95+, Best Practices 95+, SEO 90+.

Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1.

Implement image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading, static generation where possible, and bundle size optimization.

FAQ
Q: Do I need to implement the full on-chain program? A: No. The on-chain program is in the repo already. Build the frontend with clean service interfaces. Credential display (reading cNFTs from Devnet) should work — lesson completion and enrollment can be stubbed.

Q: Can I use additional libraries? A: Yes, as long as they don't conflict with required technologies. Document any additions.

Q: Do I need to create course content? A: No, we provide mock content. You build the platform and CMS structure.

Q: Can I use Supabase for user data? A: Yes, for MVP. Design clean abstractions so we can swap to on-chain later.

Q: What if I can't complete all features in 14 days? A: Prioritize core features over bonuses. A polished subset beats a buggy complete set.

Q: Can a team submit? A: Yes. Prize is per submission, not per person.

Q: Can I submit in Portuguese? A: Yes! Non-English LATAM content is welcome.
