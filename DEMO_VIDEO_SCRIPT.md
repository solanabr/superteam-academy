## LESSON + CODE PLAYGROUND (0:50–1:15)

---

## ON-CHAIN CREDENTIALS (2:05–2:25)

**[Navigate to Profile page]**

> "The most unique feature: on-chain credentials. When students complete courses, Metaplex Core NFTs are minted to their Solana wallet — verifiable achievements that live on-chain forever."

**[Show the certificates section with blockchain verification]**

> "This isn't a PDF certificate you email to yourself. It's a cryptographically verified credential on Solana devnet, tied to your wallet address."

**[Click on a certificate to show the verify link]**

> "Anyone can verify your credentials on Solana Explorer. The program ID is ACADBRCB3z... deployed to devnet."

---

## SETTINGS + DARK MODE (2:25–2:35)

**[Navigate to Settings]**

> "Settings let students customize language preference, dark/light mode, and notification preferences. Dark mode by default — because that's where developers live."

## RECORDING NOTES

- **Resolution**: 1920×1080 minimum (Superteam prefers widescreen)
- **Pace**: Don't rush — let UI animations complete (Framer Motion transitions take ~0.5s)
- **Wallet**: You may need to have Phantom installed. If not, show the dashboard stats as static (they show even without wallet connection)
- **URL to use**: https://app-roan-iota-58.vercel.app
- **pt-BR locale**: Use `/pt-BR/` prefix — should be the default on landing
- **Don't show**: Any console errors, loading spinners that don't resolve, or unimplemented features
- **Captions**: Record with English narration (judges may not speak Portuguese)
- **Length**: Keep to 2:45–3:00 — no penalties for shorter

## TALKING POINTS IF ASKED (written Q&A for submission form)

**What problem does this solve?**
Brazilian Solana developers lack structured, Portuguese-first learning resources. Generic Solana docs aren't enough to grow a local developer ecosystem. Superteam Academy provides structured tracks, community leaderboards, and on-chain credentials to verify and incentivize learning.

**Why blockchain credentials?**
Because a PDF certificate proves nothing. An on-chain credential on Solana is permanent, public, and owned by the student — not an institution. Employers and DAOs can verify skills in seconds.

**Technical differentiation?**
- Token-2022 XP tokens for gamification (not just database points)
- Metaplex Core NFTs for credentials (verifiable on-chain)
- Anchor program for lesson completion tracking (not just a course platform)
- Trilingual from day one (not a translation afterthought)
- Mobile-responsive, dark-first, accessibility-first
