Explain complex Solana blockchain code through clear narratives, visual diagrams, and step-by-step breakdowns.

## Code to Explain

$ARGUMENTS

## Related Context

- **Solana Concepts**: See [SKILL.md](../skills/SKILL.md) for concept references
- **Anchor Patterns**: See [programs-anchor.md](../skills/programs-anchor.md)
- **Learning Approach**: See **solana-guide** agent for educational patterns

## Explanation Framework

### 1. Initial Assessment

Determine:
- **Code type**: Program instruction, client code, account structure, test
- **Complexity level**: Beginner, intermediate, advanced
- **Key concepts**: What Solana/blockchain concepts are used
- **Target audience**: Adjust depth accordingly

### 2. Explanation Structure

**High-Level Overview**
- What does this code do? (1-2 sentences)
- What problem does it solve?
- Key concepts used

**Visual Diagram**
- Use Mermaid flowcharts for control flow
- Use relationship diagrams for account structures
- Use ASCII art for simple data flows

**Step-by-Step Breakdown**
- Walk through each significant section
- Explain what's happening AND why it matters
- Highlight non-obvious decisions

**Concept Deep Dives**
For Solana concepts encountered (PDAs, CPIs, etc.):
- Brief explanation of the concept
- How it's used in this code
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Security Analysis**
- Access control checks
- Validation patterns
- Potential issues or considerations

**Patterns Identified**
- Design patterns used (state machine, authority, escrow, etc.)
- Why the pattern fits this use case

### 3. Interactive Elements

Include comprehension checks:
- "What would happen if...?"
- "How would you modify this to...?"
- Links to related concepts for further learning

## Output Format

1. **Overview** - What does this code do? (2-3 sentences)
2. **Visual Diagram** - Flow chart or relationship diagram (Mermaid)
3. **Step-by-Step** - Walk through significant sections
4. **Deep Dives** - Explain Solana-specific concepts encountered
5. **Security** - Highlight security considerations
6. **Patterns** - Identify design patterns used
7. **Questions** - Comprehension checks

Adjust depth based on complexity. Simple code needs brief explanation. Complex code needs thorough breakdowns with diagrams.
